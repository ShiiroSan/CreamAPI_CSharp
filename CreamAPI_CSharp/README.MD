CreamAPI_CSharp

First of all, sorry but some part of the code will be in French. Main reason for this: I'm French, this was supposed to not be released to public but as request I did it. 
Feel free to translate my source code, and pull request it. Dc.

So, this software is made to automate the process of using CreamAPI. It will not work with every game, but most of. If it don't work, go see the thread of capi, or directly the game thread. You'll get answer there for sure.
